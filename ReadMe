For Better Debug the Mobile Parameter it is better to access localhost via phone.
But how do we do that?
Well not in the custom way you have to change "localhost" to yout IP Adress from your Computer.

Simply run Hugo on your IP not localhost:
Hugo server --baseURL="<your-ip>" --bind="<your-ip>"

Then Hugo created WebServer at http://<your-ip>:1313/
If your IP is 192.168.178.01.
then simplay Replay <your-ip> with this number.

You can change the port as well by tying additional --port:<your-port>

So here is shown all together :)
Hugo server --baseURL="192.168.178.01" --bind="192.168.178.01" --port:444

Then Hugo created WebServer at http://192.168.178.01:4444/

Therefore you can access this via a mobile device.
But be aware! You have to be in the same network!
e.g. same WLAN
